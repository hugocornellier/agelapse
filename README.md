## What's New - Mobile v1.5.1

### New Features
- Full support for Landscape photos within the app with guides/ghost photos. Thanks to those that suggested this.

### Improvements & Bug Fixes
- Project exports: fixed bug where exporting a project with stabilized photos could cause the .zip archive to fail to generate.
