This is a shared foundation library for both
[wechat_assets_picker](https://pub.dev/packages/wechat_assets_picker)
and
[wechat_camera_picker](https://pub.dev/packages/wechat_camera_picker).

## Versions compatibility

The package only guarantees to be working on **the stable version of Flutter**.
We won't update it in real-time to align with other channels of Flutter.

If you got a `resolve conflict` error when running `flutter pub get`,
